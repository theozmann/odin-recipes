# odin-recipes
Hello!
This is a recipes-themed html project as part of the foundations section of The Odin Project.
I am already pretty familiar with most of these concepts, and have experience with basic html,
css, and JS. However it's been quite some time since I have worked with these technologies. So 
I decided to start fresh and use TOP and it's resources as a refresher, and to hopefully surpass
my previous level of competency in web development.
