    <h2>One of those mason jars you can get that has all the indredients for cookies inside.</h2>
    <p>So it doesn't really say what the ingredients are in the jar, but it says to add softened butter 
        with 1 egg and some vanilla. Cream together. So if you don't have this exact jar of cookie ingredients 
        then I guess you'll have to find the ingredients from a different cookie recipe and return to this one to
        finish.
