    <h2>Chili with beans in it, it's not great, but it's cheap and works when you're too lazy to go to the store.</h2>
    <p>So I could list some of the ingredients that are listed on the can, but
        I would have to go back to my kitchen and get the can back out of the
        cabinet and I really don't wanna do that. Just go to the store, and buy
        a can of chili. I will say though, if you want the Great Value brand, 
        you're gonna have to go to Walmart specifically.
