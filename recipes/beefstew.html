    <h2>It's literally just a can of beef stew, it's a stew with beef in it.
    </h2>
    <p>So I could list some of the ingredients that are listed on the can, but
        I would have to go back to my kitchen and get the can back out of the
        cabinet and I really don't wanna do that. Just go to the store, and buy
        a can of beef stew.
